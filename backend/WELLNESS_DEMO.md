## 🤖 AI Insights Engine

The module generates smart insights by analyzing:

### 1. Activity Patterns
```javascript
// Break detection
if (breakLogs < 3 && totalCompletions > 10) {
  → "You've been skipping breaks!"
}

// Balance check
if (wellnessCount > sustainabilityCount × 3) {
  → "Great wellness focus! Add some eco goals too."
}
```

### 2. Mood Integration
Uses emotion module data:
```javascript
if (mood === 'stressed' && mindfulnessGoals < 2) {
  → "Feeling stressed? Try 5 min meditation."
}
```

### 3. Streak Encouragement
```javascript
if (currentStreak >= 7) {
  → "🔥 7-day streak! You're building amazing habits!"
}
```

### 4. Achievement Recognition
```javascript
if (isBalanced) {
  → "Perfect balance! Maintain for 'Balance Keeper' badge."
}
```
